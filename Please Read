Hi gecko242,

I am writing this here because you do not have issues enabled, and I have an inquiry: When will this board begin shipping again? Listed on Tindie and ThePiHut, it stated they would be back in stock on September 30th. If you plan on ending production, could you please make the schematics publicaly available so I could get the board fabricated?

Thanks,
Christian Newton
